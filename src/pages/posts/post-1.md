# My first blog post

Published on: 15/03/2025

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro. Here, I will share my learning journey.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating a new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post. I now have AStro pages and Markdown posts.

## What's next

I will finish the asto tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more updates.
